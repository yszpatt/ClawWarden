# Development Standards

This file defines the coding and development standards for this project.

## Code Quality
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting where possible. Use clear variable and function names.
- **Modularity**: functions should be small and do one thing well.
- **Formatting**: Adhere to standard formatters for the language in use (e.g., Prettier, Black, Gofmt).

## Git Usage
- **Commits**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **Branches**: Use feature branches for new features or significant changes.

## AI Interaction
- **Task Tracking**: Keep `task.md` up to date with progress.
- **Planning**: proper planning artifacts (`implementation_plan.md`) should be created before complex tasks.
